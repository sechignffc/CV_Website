            <h2>Career History</h2>
            <h3>LLOYDS BANKING GROUP – Dec 2018 – Dec 2024 – Contract</h3>
            <i>Tooling and Automation Consultant</i>
            <ul>
                <li>Responsible for automating the mailbox migration process from Exchange 2007 to Office 365. Utilizing PowerShell and Python, I scripted the migration workflows, integrating with the Management Studio API for seamless process management and reporting. My tasks included conducting pre-migration checks, analyzing permissions, troubleshooting and resolving issues, migrating user mailboxes, and reapplying appropriate permissions. In total, over 100,000 user mailboxes and 50,000 shared mailboxes were successfully migrated. Developed HTML-based email communications for users and leveraged the Blackberry REST API to facilitate the migration of mobile devices after the transition. </li>
                <li>Automated the migration of home drive data to OneDrive. PowerShell scripts were used to analyze the existing home drives, complete the migration and analyze the success of the migration process.</li>
                <li>Assisted with migrating from Microsoft Office 2013 to 2016, using PowerShell and Management Studio to identify devices that were ready for the upgrade. Migrations were then scheduled, and post-migration Tanium reports were used to track and document the success or failure of each migration.</li>
                <li>Developed processes to support projects migrating colleagues to Windows Hello, Citrix, and Outlook Message Encryption. For each migration, PowerShell and Python scripts were used to conduct pre-migration checks, ensuring a smooth transition. These scripts used data sources, such as Azure AD, Intune, ServiceNow, and SCCM to ensure accuracy and consistency throughout the process.</li>
                <li>Led the migration of U.S. Bank of Scotland colleagues from Exchange 2013 to Office 365, following a similar process as the London migrations. I also automated the migration of home drive data to OneDrive using PowerShell and Python.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>PAGE GROUP – Apr 2016 – Dec 2017 – Contract</h3>
            <i>Infrastructure Analyst</i>
            <ul>
                <li>Originally a support role, I was seconded to the delivery team to assist with migrating all UK mailboxes to Office 365. The project team were encountering significant challenges. Performed a company-wide pilot to assess the difficulties and identify effective solutions for a smoother migration process.</li>
                <li>On taking responsibility for UK migrations, provided analysis of existing mailboxes and the links between them, allowing migrations to be scheduled around these links, rather than just geographical location. Planned the migration schedule based around these findings.</li>
                <li>Scripted the migration process using Python and PowerShell, also using scripts to perform pre and post migration checks. In doing so, we were able to preempt and prevent many of the issues we had seen previously. The project was delivered successfully, meeting the new deadlines required by the business.</li>
                <li>When not on the Office 365 migration, I worked in the operations team supporting the Page Group UK environment. Later, teams were merged, and support covered the whole EMEA region. Page Group have a user base of around 12000 users worldwide and 100s of servers, mostly virtual. These virtual servers are hosted either in the cloud on the Microsoft Windows Azure platform or onsite on vSphere. Responsibilities include administering and building servers on Windows Azure.</li>
                <li>Whilst in the operations team, became the primary engineer for anything messaging related. This included Office 365, Exchange 2010/2007, Mimecast, Exclaimer and Archive Manager. Page Group have a hybrid environment between Exchange 2010 and Exchange Online, with some Exchange 2007 servers remaining. Responsible for dealing with any major Exchange issues, as well as patching/upgrading the environment.</li>
                <li>However, as part of the Operations team, supported Windows Servers (2003, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012 R2) and Active Directory, VMWare vSphere (5.5, 6), Citrix XenApp 5.5, NetScaler and Commvault Backups.</li>
